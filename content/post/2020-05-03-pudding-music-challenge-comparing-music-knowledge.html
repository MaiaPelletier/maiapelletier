<p>First things first, I need to give away all the credit for this idea. Thanks to Namita (@<a href="https://twitter.com/nnstats">nnstats</a> on Twitter) since this blog post was fully inspired by this tweet.</p>

<p>It was such a fun idea, I decided to do it too!</p>
<p>I love <a href="https://pudding.cool/">The Pudding</a>. I think it‚Äôs an awesome website doing awesome things. This week they released a visual analysis of <a href="https://pudding.cool/2020/04/music-challenge/">gaps in generational music knowledge</a>. Before accessing the analysis, you can test your own music knowledge for any decade from 1960s-2010s. I thought this was super fun and after seeing Namita‚Äôs tweet where she plotted her own data, I figured this could make a fun little blogpost :smile:.</p>
<p>Instead of just analyzing my own data though, I thought it would be fun to compare my knowledge to someone else my age. So I recruited my (semi-willing) boyfriend and we ended up spending an hour of our Saturday night quizzing ourselves on music (what else are we gonna do in quarantine anyway?).</p>
<p>The Pudding quiz gives you 10 random songs from the decade you choose. So to increase our sample, I had both of us do a quiz for each decade 3 times. So at the end we had tested ourselves on 30 hit songs from 8 decades. Here‚Äôs the resulting data:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pudding_data &lt;- 
  read_csv(&quot;pudding_music_challenge.csv&quot;) %&gt;% 
  mutate(knowledge = fct_inorder(knowledge))

<p>If you‚Äôre interested in how I got this data, I copy+pasted our results from the Pudding music quiz into Excel and from there, I cleaned and structured the data in R. You can see the code <a href="https://gist.github.com/MaiaPelletier/be58ae7a2a73b5f48e0c38901ca52ffa">here</a>.</p>
<p>There were 4 knowledge levels to choose from in the Pudding quiz: <strong>don‚Äôt know it, sounds familiar, know it</strong> and <strong>singing the lyrics</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: I will be referencing my bf as ‚ÄúJ‚Äù and me as ‚ÄúM‚Äù in all the plot legends.</p>
<p>Overall, how many songs did we get right?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pudding_data %&gt;%
  add_count(name, name = &#39;total_songs&#39;) %&gt;%
  filter(knowledge %in% c(&#39;know it&#39;, &#39;singing the lyrics&#39;)) %&gt;%
  group_by(name) %&gt;%
  count(name, total_songs, name = &#39;correct&#39;) %&gt;%

<p>Yikes‚Ä¶ <em>Overall</em> we more or less failed. But since we belong to the youngest generation accounted for in this generational analysis, that can‚Äôt be too surprising.</p>
<p>But I‚Äôm not here to prove my unbeatable musical expertise. I‚Äôm only here to prove that I know more music than J and so far, we‚Äôre on the right track - Overall, I knew 10% more songs than J.</p>
<p>I used <code>ggbeeswarm</code> to visualize the results of all the songs we tested ourselves on. Where did we do better/worse? Do our results mirror each other‚Äôs or do they vastly differ?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(2016)
p &lt;- 
  pudding_data %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(year, knowledge)) +
  geom_beeswarm(aes(color = name),
                groupOnX = FALSE,
                show.legend = F) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  facet_wrap(.~name, ncol = 2) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks()) +
  scale_color_pjo(name = NULL)
p</code></pre>

Our ‚Äú<strong>don‚Äôt know it</strong>‚Äù data looks pretty full‚Ä¶ I was honestly surprised how many songs we didn‚Äôt know! I‚Äôm not claiming to be some sort of expert but I thought I at least knew the <em>hits</em> from all these decades (whether through my own music or my parents). J was especially surprised with his results because he was raised on an overdose of classic rock radio stations.</p>
<p>Throwing a <code>geom_smooth()</code> on the plot, using <code>method = loess</code>, is helpful to see the years where we did better/worse.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>p + 
  geom_beeswarm(color = &#39;grey65&#39;,
                groupOnX = FALSE) +
  geom_smooth(aes(year, as.numeric(knowledge), color = name),
              method = &#39;loess&#39;,
              se = FALSE,
              size = 0.8)</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>At a quick glance, our results look like they are fairly similar (as you would expect of 2 people born in the same year).</p></li>
<li><p>You can see there‚Äôs an immediate increase in music recognition in the 2000s where we started to actually recognize the music we grew up with.</p></li>
<li><p>In general, it looks like J‚Äôs ‚Äú<strong>don‚Äôt know it</strong>‚Äù is more saturated than mine. This <em>could</em> mean that I know more music :smirk:. However, where I listened to probably around ~30 seconds of each song, he was quick to click ‚Äú<strong>don‚Äôt know it</strong>‚Äù after about 10 seconds, so this could also mean he missed parts of a song that he might have recognized.</p></li>
<li><p>There was a lot of stuff that sounded familiar to me but I couldn‚Äôt quite place, especially in the 1980s-1990s.</p></li>
<li><p>When we hit the 2000s, things stopped ‚Äúsounding familiar‚Äù to me and I either just knew the song or I didn‚Äôt. Whereas J had songs that he couldn‚Äôt quite place over all the decades.</p></li>
<li><p>I think I was more liberal with the <strong>singing the lyrics</strong> option since to me generally <em>knowing a song</em> = <em>knowing the lyrics</em>. Considering that, J and I had pretty similar knowledge of the 2000s and 2010s.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I was curious to see what music we knew from decade to decade (aka which decades can I boast more music knowledge than J), so I aggregated the ‚Äúknow it‚Äùs and the ‚Äúsinging it‚Äùs to visualize this.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>decade_knowledge &lt;- 
  pudding_data %&gt;%
  mutate(knowledge2 = ifelse(
    knowledge %in% c(&quot;don&#39;t know it&quot;, &quot;sounds famililar&quot;),
    &quot;don&#39;t know it&quot;,
    &quot;know it&quot;
    )) %&gt;%
  filter(knowledge2 == &quot;know it&quot;) %&gt;% 
  count(name, year_dec) %&gt;%
  mutate(percent = n/30)

decade_knowledge %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(year_dec, percent)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = name), 
           position = &quot;dodge&quot;,
           width = 4) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = &quot;% of songs known&quot;) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = c(1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010),
    labels = c(&#39;60s&#39;, &#39;70s&#39;, &#39;80s&#39;, &#39;90s&#39;, &#39;00s&#39;, &#39;10s&#39;)
    ) +
  scale_fill_pjo(name = NULL) +
  theme(legend.margin = margin(b = 5, unit = &#39;mm&#39;),
        legend.key.width = unit(2, &#39;mm&#39;))</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>J is not at all familiar with the music in the 90s, only recognizing &lt;15% of songs. This is a little surprising but also understandable I guess since we were born in the mid-late 90s.</p></li>
<li><p>I did surprisingly ok in the 60s (recognizing over 50% of songs!). Definitely not <em>well</em> üòÖ, but I was expecting that to be my worst decade. It turned out that I recognized the least music from the 70s (also a bit surprising to me, I thought the 70s would be my best decade pre-2000).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The only category where J came close to beating me was in the 70s, where we tied. So all in all, I think I get to pretty decisively take the win in all the decades otherwise!:trophy:</p>
<p>This was super fun to work on so thanks again to Namita for the awesome tweet+idea :smile:. For any questions, comments, admonishments of my lacking music knowledge, etc, you can find me on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/MaiaPelletier">here</a>.</p>
