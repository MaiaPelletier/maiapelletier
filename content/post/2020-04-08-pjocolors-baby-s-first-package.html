<p>About a 2 weeks ago, I <a href="https://twitter.com/MaiaPelletier/status/1244984817206337537">tweeted out</a> that I had released my first package <a href="https://github.com/MaiaPelletier/pjocolours">pjocolors</a>, which contains 5 colour palettes based on the (original) book covers of <em>Percy Jackson and the Olympians</em> by Rick Riordan. Today I released the first update, complete with <strong>updated palettes</strong> and <strong>new functions</strong> for use with <code>ggplot2</code>:bar_chart:!</p>
<p>I decided to develop this simple package, not so much for utility purposes (although Iâ€™ve used it in two <strong>#TidyTuesday</strong>â€™s now!) or out of sheer nerdiness and nostalgia (although that did play a part as well :smile:), but because I have been curious about package development for a while. So I figured: <em>what better time to learn than <strong>quarantine</strong>? </em></p>

<h2>The process</h2>
<p>I was inspired to develop a colour palette package for a few reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>I had just re-read the Lightning Thief :zap:.<br />
</li>
<li>Iâ€™m a sucker for a pretty colour palette :art:.<br />
</li>
<li>It seemed like a simple place to start discovering the world of package development.<br />
</li>
<li>I had recently become obsessed with a couple different colour palette packages (which I use <em>constantly</em>): <a href="https://nschiett.github.io/fishualize/index.html">fishualize</a> and <a href="https://github.com/katiejolly/nationalparkcolors">nationalparkcolors</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a lot of <strong>thanks</strong> and praise to give to these two packages. Theyâ€™ve provided me with some beautiful palettes that Iâ€™ve used in various graphics and Iâ€™ve crawled through their code a few times over to help me understand how colour palette packages are set-up.</p>
<p>I still have a lot to learn about developing packages, but I have to say that this was a great little exercise! Iâ€™m so grateful that the <code>devtools</code> package exists, it made the whole process so painless.</p>
<p>Some great resources that I consulted to learn about the basics of writing packages were</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/">R package primer</a> by Karl Broman<br />
</li>
<li><a href="https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/">Writing an R package from scratch</a> by Hilary Parker<br />
</li>
<li><a href="https://tinyheero.github.io/jekyll/update/2015/07/26/making-your-first-R-package.html">Making Your First R Package</a> by Fong Chun Chan<br />
</li>
<li><a href="http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/">R packages</a> by Hadley Wickham (of course).</li>
</ul>
<p>I highly recommend these resources if youâ€™re looking to learn the basics of R packages too. All in all, I would say getting a handle of the basics (but just the basics) took me less than a day (thanks to these great writers).</p>
<p>These last couple weeks, Iâ€™ve spent a lot of time on <em>#rstats</em> twitter and reading other R bloggerâ€™s posts. My eyes have opened to R development and Iâ€™m definitely cultivating a rising interest in the topic. Iâ€™m already working on turning <code>pjocolors</code> into a <em>real</em> package that other people would want to use (and not just my little pet project). Iâ€™m excited to dive into it more as quarantine drags on and see what comes out of it ðŸ‘©

<div id="a-bit-about-pjocolors" class="section level2">
<h2>A bit about pjocolors</h2>
<p>pjocolors v0.1.1 contains <em>6 colour palettes</em>. Currently all palettes only contain 5 colours (however I hope to expand this in the future). The palette options can be accessed as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(pjocolors)
names(pjo_palettes)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;LightningThief&quot;    &quot;SeaOfMonsters&quot;     &quot;TitansCurse&quot;      
## [4] &quot;BatOfTheLabyrinth&quot; &quot;LastOlympian&quot;      &quot;LastOlympian2&quot;</code></pre>

<div id="use" class="section level4">
<h4>Use</h4>
<p>To illustrate how to use the palettes, I downloaded some cool data on library check-outs of Percy Jackson related materials from the <a href="https://data.seattle.gov/Community/Checkouts-by-Title/tmmm-ytt6/data">Checkouts by Title</a> database from the awesome <em>City of Seattle Open Data Portal</em>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Read in data (which I downloaded from the database)
pjo_checkouts &lt;- read_csv(&#39;percyjacksoncheckouts.csv&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Iâ€™ll use this data to create a couple plots and apply some of the <code>pjo_palettes</code> to them by using <code>scale_color_pjo</code> and <code>scale_fill_pjo</code>.</p>
<div id="discrete-scale" class="section level5">
<h5>Discrete Scale</h5>
<p>Good palettes to use for discrete scales: <strong>LightningThief</strong>, <strong>TitansCurse</strong>, <strong>BatOfTheLabyrinth</strong>, <strong>LastOlympian.</strong></p>
<pre class="r"><code># Make plots
p1 &lt;- 
  pjo_checkouts %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(CheckoutYear, checkouts, color = MaterialType)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  labs(x = &#39;Year&#39;, y = &#39;Number of checkouts&#39;) +
  guides(colour = guide_legend(&quot;&quot;))

p2 &lt;- 
  pjo_checkouts %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(reorder(MaterialType, -checkouts), checkouts)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = MaterialType), show.legend = FALSE, 
           alpha = 0.8, width = 0.65) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = &#39;Number of checkouts&#39;)

# Apply pjocolors (default = LightningThief)

</div>
<div id="continuous-scale" class="section level5">
<h5>Continuous Scale</h5>
<p>Good palettes to use for continuous scales: <strong>LightningThief</strong> (diverging scales), <strong>SeaOfMonsters</strong> (sequential scales), <strong>LastOlympian2</strong> (sequential scales).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>p3 &lt;- 
  pjo_checkouts %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(CheckoutMonth, checkouts, group = CheckoutMonth)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = checkouts), alpha = 0.65) +

  scale_x_continuous(labels = month.abb, breaks = 1:12) +
  guides(color = guide_colorbar(title = &#39;Number of checkouts&#39;))

# Apply pjocolors (SeaOfMonsters)
p3 + scale_color_pjo(palette = &#39;SeaOfMonsters&#39;, discrete = FALSE)</code></pre>

<div id="a-note-about-base-graphics" class="section level5">
<h5>A Note about base graphics</h5>
<p>These colour palettes are able to be used for base graphics too! Rather than using the <code>scale_color_pjo</code> function, one could also just construct a palette as follows</p>
<pre class="r"><code># A palette with 
pal &lt;- pjo_palettes$TitansCurse</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="future-plans-for-pjocolors" class="section level2">
<h2>Future plans for pjocolors</h2>
<p>The ideal is for this package to be a well-documented, general-use colour palette package. What this means to me right now is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accessibility! I want to make sure I have some colourblind-safe options.</li>
<li>Expanding the numbers of colours in some of the palettes.<br />
</li>
<li>Expanding colour palette options (Thereâ€™s more books to add!).<br />
</li>
<li>Updating the colour palettes to make sure they adhere to general colour rules (aka they look as nice as possible).</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course Iâ€™m open to any and all ideas on how this little package of mine could be improved, so feel free to tweet at me @<a href="https://twitter.com/MaiaPelletier">MaiaPelletier</a> if you have any ideas for me :brain:.</p>
