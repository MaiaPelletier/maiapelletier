<p>After more dedicated hours than I would like to admit, my website is finally up and running! A huge thank you to the <code>blogdown</code> package which made this process as painless as possible. I have been lining up ideas for blogposts for a year, I’m glad I finally found the time to create the site to host them all. I’ve always had a love of writing, so transitioning those skills to my personal website should be lots of fun.</p>
<p>I am super excited to use this website to share my various thoughts, ideas, opinions, and projects with the amazing <strong>#rstats</strong> community. I’ve really delved into R this last year and it’s been such a fun journey. I’m hoping to use this website to track my learning progress and share a little bit about myself in the process.</p>
<p>Feel free to connect with me on <a href="http://twitter.com/MaiaPelletier">Twitter</a> to get to know me a little better.</p>
<p>My name exists on a website now! So cool!</p>
