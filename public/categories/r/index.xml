      <description>First things first, I need to give away all the credit for this idea. Thanks to Namita (@nnstats on Twitter) since this blog post was fully inspired by this tweet.
had to graph my results from @puddingviz&#39;s delightful generational music challenge (https://t.co/6MBp6cdTla) and it turns out I started knowing what music was in ~2005 pic.twitter.com/AwxhPblwZdâ€” Namita (@nnstats) May 2, 2020It was such a fun idea, I decided to do it too!</description>

      <description>About a 2 weeks ago, I tweeted out that I had released my first package pjocolors, which contains 5 colour palettes based on the (original) book covers of Percy Jackson and the Olympians by Rick Riordan. Today I released the first update, complete with updated palettes and new functions for use with ggplot2ðŸ“Š!
I decided to develop this simple package, not so much for utility purposes (although Iâ€™ve used it in two #TidyTuesdayâ€™s now!</description>

      <description>For this weekâ€™s #TidyTuesday, I decided that I wanted to do an in-depth exploration of the this weekâ€™s dataset of Tour de France winners, and write a blog post about how I generally go about my data exploration for Tidy Tuesday.
However, I desperately need to preface this blog post: I went into this weekâ€™s #TidyTuesday excited to learn more about a sport I know almost nothing about. Iâ€™ve come out of it completely obsessed with the drama and insanity that is the history of the Tour de France.</description>
