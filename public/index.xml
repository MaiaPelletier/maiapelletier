      <description>After more dedicated hours than I would like to admit, my website is finally up and running! A huge thank you to the blogdown package which made this process as painless as possible. I have been lining up ideas for blogposts for a year, I’m glad I finally found the time to create the site to host them all. I’ve always had a love of writing, so transitioning those skills to my personal website should be lots of fun.</description>
