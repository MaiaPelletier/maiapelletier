      <description>For this weekâ€™s #TidyTuesday, I decided that I wanted to do an in-depth exploration of the this weekâ€™s dataset of Tour de France winners, and write a blog post about how I generally go about my data exploration for Tidy Tuesday.
However, I desperately need to preface this blog post: I went into this weekâ€™s #TidyTuesday excited to learn more about a sport I know almost nothing about. Iâ€™ve come out of it completely obsessed with the drama and insanity that is the history of the Tour de France.</description>

      <description>After more dedicated hours than I would like to admit, my website is finally up and running! A huge thank you to the blogdown package which made this process as painless as possible. I have been lining up ideas for blogposts for a year, Iâ€™m glad I finally found the time to create the site to host them all. Iâ€™ve always had a love of writing, so transitioning those skills to my personal website should be lots of fun.</description>
