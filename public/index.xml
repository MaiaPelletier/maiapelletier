      <description>About a 2 weeks ago, I tweeted out that I had released my first package pjocolors, which contains 5 colour palettes based on the (original) book covers of Percy Jackson and the Olympians by Rick Riordan. Today I released the first update, complete with updated palettes and new functions for use with ggplot2📊!
I decided to develop this simple package, not so much for utility purposes (although I’ve used it in two #TidyTuesday’s now!</description>

      <description>For this week’s #TidyTuesday, I decided that I wanted to do an in-depth exploration of the this week’s dataset of Tour de France winners, and write a blog post about how I generally go about my data exploration for Tidy Tuesday.
However, I desperately need to preface this blog post: I went into this week’s #TidyTuesday excited to learn more about a sport I know almost nothing about. I’ve come out of it completely obsessed with the drama and insanity that is the history of the Tour de France.</description>

      <description>After more dedicated hours than I would like to admit, my website is finally up and running! A huge thank you to the blogdown package which made this process as painless as possible. I have been lining up ideas for blogposts for a year, I’m glad I finally found the time to create the site to host them all. I’ve always had a love of writing, so transitioning those skills to my personal website should be lots of fun.</description>
